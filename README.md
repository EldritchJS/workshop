# Insightful apps on OpenShift

This workshop will teach you how to deploy insightful apps on OpenShift.

For the hands-on portion, you'll want to pull the `willb/workshop:notebook` image:

You'll also want to clone the [git repository](https://github.com/elmiko/var-sandbox) for the application skeleton we'll be fleshing out in the workshop:

`git clone https://github.com/elmiko/var-sandbox`.

To run the notebook, use

`docker run -p 8888:8888 willb/workshop:notebook`
